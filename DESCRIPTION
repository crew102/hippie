Description: An RStudio Addin for Hippie Expand (AKA Hippie Code
  Completion or Cyclic Expand Word). Hippie Completion searches for matching
  tokens within the user's current source editor file, regardless of file type.
  By searching only within the current source file, Hippie offers a fast way to
  identify and insert completions that appear around the user's cursor.
